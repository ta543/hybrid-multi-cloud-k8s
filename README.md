# Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Infrastructure with Service Mesh 🌐🔗

## Project Overview 📜

This project aims to architect and deploy a **hybrid and multi-cloud Kubernetes environment** using Terraform, spanning across an on-premises data center, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. By integrating advanced networking solutions, security features, and observability tools with a service mesh, this project showcases the ability to manage complex, distributed infrastructures seamlessly.

## Objective 🎯

- To deploy Kubernetes clusters in various environments including an on-premises data center, AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), and Google Cloud (GKE), ensuring high availability and scalability.
- To implement a unified service mesh across all clusters for secure communication, traffic management, and enhanced observability.
- To establish a robust CI/CD pipeline that supports multi-environment deployments and dynamic environment creation for testing.
- To demonstrate expertise in using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), applying best practices in security, and designing a disaster recovery plan.

## Project Features ✨

- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Deployment across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and on-premises data centers.
- **Networking**: Advanced solutions for inter-cluster communication, including VPNs and cloud-specific direct connections.
- **Service Mesh**: Integration of Istio or Linkerd to facilitate secure and efficient inter-service communication.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Utilization of GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack or Loki.
- **Multi-Cloud Load Balancing**: Global traffic management using Cloudflare or equivalent platforms.
- **Security**: Implementation of network policies, mTLS, RBAC, and secrets management.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform modules, workspaces, and state management for provisioning and managing resources.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Strategies for data backup and cross-region/cluster replication to ensure business continuity.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Access to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and an on-premises data center.
- Terraform installed and configured.
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes, service meshes (Istio or Linkerd), and CI/CD concepts.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**: Get a local copy of the code.
2. **Configure your cloud provider credentials**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions and API keys set up for Terraform to interact with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` within each cloud provider's directory under `terraform/environments/`.
